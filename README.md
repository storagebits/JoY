# JoY
JoY is a robot. It is inspired by family ideas and built with available hardware in our home. This project began during the lockdown when we had some time to kill.

It is based on a Thymio (https://www.thymio.org/) for the moves and on a Raspberry Pi for the whole control.

The Raspberry control the Thymio via dBus. It can work wirelessly via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).

The robot can be controlled via a radio remote control at different speeds.


This an "unfinished" or an "always ongoing" project. Just sharing.
